## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Anjali! I'm a web developer based in India. 

I'm currently working at RunDTC as a Software Engineer!
Being a creative individual, frontend generally excites me more and I like creating visually appealing user-experiences. 
I'm tech agnostic and see tools and technologies only as a medium to solve human problems and simplify their lives. 
I like to keep things clean and simple and I'm a big fan of superior quality designs & products. I'm rigourously working on building my portfolio website, until then my GitHub shall serve as my portfolio :) 

What I like doing: 
  - creating stunning web apps / websites 
  - solving problems and fixing bugs (bug hunting is one of my favorite things to do!)
  - making things responsive to enhance user experience
  - collaborating with talented UI/UX designers and developers
  - learning! (big believer of being a student my whole life)
  - playing string instruments (Ukulele and Sitar)

What I don't enjoy doing but I'm quite good at: 
  - synthesizing bulk information in a condensed form
  - data analysis and visualisation
  - writing technical documentation
  - public speaking
  - project management
  - reading & writing research papers
  - computational fluid dynamics
