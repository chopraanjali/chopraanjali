## Hi there 👋

My name is Anjali!

I'm a Software Engineer, currently working at RunDTC. I like creating visually appealing user-experiences and solving problems through code. 
I'm tech agnostic and see tools and technologies only as a medium to solve human problems and simplify lives. 
I like to keep things clean and simple and I'm a big fan of superior quality designs & products. I'm veryyyy slowly working on building my portfolio website, until then my GitHub shall serve as my portfolio :) 

What I like doing: 
  - creating responsive and stunning web apps / websites 
  - solving problems and fixing bugs (bug hunting is one of my favorite things to do!)
  - collaborating with talented UI/UX designers and developers
  - learning! (big believer of being a student my whole life)
  - playing string instruments (Ukulele and Sitar)

What I don't enjoy doing but I'm quite good at: 
  - synthesizing and making sense of bulk information
  - data analysis and visualisation
  - writing technical documentation
  - public speaking
  - project management
  - reading & writing research papers
  - computational fluid dynamics
